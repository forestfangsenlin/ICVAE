- RDKit
- numpy
- matplotlib

## How to runï¼Ÿ

ICVAE contains two python files, **ICVAE_1prop_gen.ipynb** is the ICVAE model that using one molecular property to train and can use the latent vaiable to control the generated molecular property, and the **ICVAE_2prop_gen.ipynb** is the ICVAE model that using two molecular property to train and can use the latent vaiable to control the two generated molecular properties.
